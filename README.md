# Sparkeats

**Sparkboxers review food and drink places so you can eat well**  
Built with Handlebars, Sass, and Node.js

Welcome to Sparkeats! The purpose of this site is to provide reviews and recommendations from sparkboxers of places we love to eat and drink.

## To Run the Site Locally

Instructions for running the site locally are saved in a wiki here: [https://github.com/sparkbox/sparkeats/wiki/Running-Sparkeats-Locally](https://github.com/sparkbox/sparkeats/wiki/Running-Sparkeats-Locally)

## To Contribute to the Site

Are you a sparkboxer who wants to add a review? Great! The first thing you need to do is create a new branch:

1.  Click the dropdown button at the top of the page that says **Branch: master**.
2.  In the box where it says "Find or create a branch...", enter a name for your branch.
    - Your branch name should include your name and the name of the place you are reviewing. For example _jane-magically-marvelous-macarons_
3.  You can either hit enter/return or click on the **Create Branch** button that has appeared below.
4.  The dropdown button at the top of the page should now read **Branch: jane-magically-marvelous-macarons**.

Then, go to the Sparkeats site ([http://eats.seesparkbox.com/](http://eats.seesparkbox.com/)) and see if the place you want to review is already listed there (the username and password are saved in 1Password, search for "eats").

If it is, all you need to do is add your review! You can find the instructions for adding a review here: [https://github.com/sparkbox/sparkeats/wiki/Adding-a-Review](https://github.com/sparkbox/sparkeats/wiki/Adding-a-Review)

If it is not, you will need to add some information about your place as well: [https://github.com/sparkbox/sparkeats/wiki/Adding-a-Place](https://github.com/sparkbox/sparkeats/wiki/Adding-a-Place)

Once you are done adding your information, review, and any images you want to add ([https://github.com/sparkbox/sparkeats/wiki/Adding-Images](https://github.com/sparkbox/sparkeats/wiki/Adding-Images)), you will need to submit a pull request:

1.  From the main repository page, click **New Pull Request**
2.  Add any additional information you think is necessary and click **Create Pull Request**
3.  **Add Assignees**: Heather Taylor and Katy Bowman.
4.  You can preview your PR on Heroku at ([https://dashboard.heroku.com/pipelines/93f65033-0319-48ac-a12b-90f092211fd8](https://dashboard.heroku.com/pipelines/93f65033-0319-48ac-a12b-90f092211fd8))

Thanks for your help!

### Version info

This app was originally generated on Wed May 23 2018 17:06:24 GMT-0400 (EDT) using Sails v1.0.2.

<!-- Internally, Sails used [`sails-generate@1.15.25`](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-generate/tree/v1.15.25/lib/core-generators/new). -->

<!--
Note:  Generators are usually run using the globally-installed `sails` CLI (command-line interface).  This CLI version is _environment-specific_ rather than app-specific, thus over time, as a project's dependencies are upgraded or the project is worked on by different developers on different computers using different versions of Node.js, the Sails dependency in its package.json file may differ from the globally-installed Sails CLI release it was originally generated with.  (Be sure to always check out the relevant [upgrading guides](https://sailsjs.com/upgrading) before upgrading the version of Sails used by your app.  If you're stuck, [get help here](https://sailsjs.com/support).)
