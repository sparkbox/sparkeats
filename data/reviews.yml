katy-table-33:
  place-id: table-33
  review-text: This is one of the most gluten-free-friendly restaurants in the Dayton region. Everything they bake in-house is gluten free (including their brownies and muffins, which are delicious), although they do bring in regular bread and buns for their sandwiches and burgers. I highly recommend the Chicken and Waffles and the Quiche.

  review-text: I'm in love with Table 33! Upon my first visit I tried the quiche, which was wonderfully delicious. The light, flaky crust was an absolute delight. My second visit was even better! I chose the gluten-free Bananas Foster Waffles. They were A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!!! Brown sugar syrup, bananas and blueberries layered on top of a perfectly browned waffle. The menu also listed an amazing selection of gluten-free baked goods. I'm looking forward to my next visit!

  review-text: My first experience with Zombie Dogz was at an event catered by their food truck. I had the Killer Gauge dog with slow cooked buffalo chicken topped with blue cheese crumbles, celery bits and drizzled in ranch dressing. It was pretty amazing. I was extremely excited to learn that they offer gluten free hot dog buns. WINNER! Recently I visited their location on Brown Street and tried the Juan of Dead featuring slow cooked bbq pulled pork topped with shredded swiss cheese, diced dill pickles and drizzled with yellow mustard. It was good, but not as good as the Killer Gauge.

  place-id: basils-on-market
  review-text: I prefer the lunch menu versus the dinner menu at Basil's. There are more gluten free options available during lunch. The open faced caprese (minus the bread) and the market toss salad are my favorites! The truffle fries are also pretty aweseme! Basil's has two locations, one in Dayton and the original in Troy. I have always found the service and the food better at the Troy location. The Dayton location has a great view of the river and a fantastic outdoor patio.

katy-bareburger:
  place-id: bareburger
  review-text: Bareburger is basically a burger, fries, and shakes kind of place, although they do offer salads and other sandwiches. They have a list of specialty burgers to choose from or you can build your own. You can get burgers made from beef, bison, black beans, duck, elk, quinoa, grilled lemon chicken, sesame ginger beef, sweet potato and wild rice, turkey, or wild boar. All except the black bean and quinoa are gluten free. For your bun, to keep it gluten free you can choose to have your burger on a tapioca bun, with no bun, served on a lettuce bed, or wrapped with a collard. Their french fries and sweet potato fries are fried separately and kept gluten free. Other gluten free items are listed clearly on the menu. Beyond their burgers and fries, I also highly recommend trying their milkshakes. My personal favorite is the Mexican Chocolate, made with chocolate ice cream, cayenne, cinnamon, and a “torched marshmallow.” Just thinking about it makes me want one.

  review-text: The Sleepy Bee Cafe in Oakley, near Cincinnati (they also have a location in Blue Ash), is a very cute little restaurant. I visited on a Friday morning around 9:30 and the place was almost full. The food was delicious, I had the gluten free Bee Cakes—made with almond, quinoa, and buckwheat flour—and bacon and while the pancakes were heavier than normal pancakes, they weren't gritty at all. The only drawback was the space got very loud and it became difficult to have a conversation.

Friends from Pittsburgh recommended sharing the Parrillada Mixta featuring over a pound of New York strip steak, grilled chicken breast and sweet -or- spicy chorizo paired with a side of Papas al Horno (oven roasted red potatoes with whole garlic cloves and fresh rosemary). It was fantastic! A word of warning when visiting Gaucho, be prepared to wait. Don't worry, it's worth it!

You generally have to wait in line, and then you have to eat quick and get out of there because lingering over a meal is frowned upon. It's also noisy and has bad lighting. I still haven't found the thing worth going back for, other than the carrots with goat cheese. Get those! You can't go wrong with ordering a steak. Some of the sandwiches are messy and overwhelming. The burger is probably your best bet if you go that direction. A lot of hype!

  review-text: Wonderful coffee in Market Square - can also buy loose tea, beans, and fresh roasted peanuts. Earlier in 2017 they had a fire and were closed for a while. They did some renovations before re-opening and they helpfully moved the coffee bar across the back so there’s more room to order and a more conventional spot to add cream and milk. Looks clean and fresh and I’m relieved it’s back!
